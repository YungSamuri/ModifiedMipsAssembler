# Modified Mips Assembler
This was a school assignment where we were tasked with creating an assembler in python. The assembler is for a modified version of MIPS assembly. It takes in the modified MIPS assembly codes and outputs two hex files, one which contains the program instructions, and another which contains the program data.
